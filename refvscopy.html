    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);          OUTPUTS 100 100
    // age = 200;
        // console.log(age, age2);    OUTPUTS 200 100

    // console.log(name, name2);        OUTPUTS WES WES
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);        OUTPUTS WESLEY WES 

    // THE VALUE OF AGE2 AND NAME2 IS SET BEFORE AGE AND NAME VARS ARE CHANGED 


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const players2 = [...players];
    console.table({players2})

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(captain)
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };                                          // If I make a copy of wes and change on of the social values of the copy, it will update the original too! Annoying. A way around this is to do line 86:

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));           // this takes the object and uses json.stringify to turn into a string, then turns it back into an object. Thus create a real copy with any mappings
